## About The Project

This is a solo project I built to strengthen my fundamentals in front-end development.

Throughout this project, I focused on improving:

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS layout and positioning
- Typography and spacing
- Button styling and UI basics
- Google Fonts integration
- Clean project organization

The design concept was based on a Scrimba design specification, and the implementation was completed entirely by me.
